def search(ls, num): #search function will take in a list (ls) and a number (num)
  '''
  This function will take in a list of numbers as ls, such as [1, 2, 3] and a number as num, such as 2. 
  The function should return the zero-based index of that number which would be 1 in this case.
  Return -1 if the number could not be found. This multi-lined string will have no effect on your program
  and can be removed, if desired.
